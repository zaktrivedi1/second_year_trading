## About
Personal project experimenting with algorithmic trading in my second year summer (of BSc Physics), after reading the book The Way of the Turtle by Curtis M Faith. Completed whilst travelling through Colombia in the attempt to earn a bit of extra spending money. This was developed without real knowledge of proffesional quantitative finance and hence at the time I did not no about python packages like yfinance and instead manually collected the stock data daily. Similarly, I did not know how to connect my programme to a brokerage site and hence I made the trades manually each morning. However, due to the ong moving averages chose, it was executable and I did end up making some extra spending money for my travels!

## Features

- Backtested dual moving average method on historical stock data to find optimal values for each moving average and whether the technique could produce a return above the risk free rate.
- Use the moving averages programme to read in new daily stock data andgive me indicators of when to long or short each stock.
